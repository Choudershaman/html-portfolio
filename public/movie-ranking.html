<h3>Intouchables</h3>

<p>"The Intouchables" has an element of truth that it never quite recognizes. 
    The role of a good caregiver is hardly limited to lifting, bathing, grooming,
    dressing, pushing and supplying medicines. The patient is faced with a reality 
    he finds difficult to accept: he has been deprived of all he once took for granted, 
    such as the simple ability to walk across a room. A caregiver can't provide that, 
    but he can provide something more valuable, companionship. Philippe's wife is dead, 
    his teenage daughter is a snotty brat, and his staff is preoccupied by their salaries 
    and status. Driss comes from a different world.</p><br/>

<h3>Green Book</h3>

<p>It’s pure formula, of course. Two men—one white, one black—from polar opposite backgrounds 
   with wildly contrasting personalities get thrown together under unusual circumstances. They 
   learn from each other, change each other for the better and discover that—guess what?—they’re 
   not so different after all.</p><br/>

   <h3>Arthur the King</h3>

   <p>The word “sport” does not begin to do it justice. Adventure Team Racing is the most extreme, 
      demanding, endurance activity in the world. It makes the Iron Man combination of running, swimming, 
      and biking look like a game of hopscotch. An adventure race can involve running, biking, climbing, 
      kayaking, and any other imaginable strenuous movement forward, over every possible kind of treacherous 
      terrain. Races can last for many days, with only brief permissible stops and time penalties for aids 
      like IV fluids. “Arthur the King” is based on the true story of one of these races, with an American 
      team racing through the jungles, mountains, and rivers of the Dominican Republic (the real story involved 
      a Swedish team in Ecuador). Mark Wahlberg plays team leader Michael Light, who bonds with a stray dog he 
      names Arthur. </p>
